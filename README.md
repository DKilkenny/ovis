# OVis: OpenMDAO Visualization

OVis is a desktop application that allows you to visualize the
data you've recorded using OpenMDAO's SQLite recorder. To use:
simply open OVis, select your SQLite database file, and use the
N<sup>2</sup> diagram to look at your model hierarchy and plots
to see iteration history.
